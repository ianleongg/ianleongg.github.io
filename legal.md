This is a personal website and should not have complicated rules. Nevertheless, I must clarify some things.

Effective September 6, 2020.

## Privacy

I do not collect personally-identifiable information.

No cookies are used/stored.

I cannot modify/delete your data if I don't have them to begin with.
