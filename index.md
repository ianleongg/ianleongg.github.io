## Quick About Me
---
Born and raised in Malaysia but currently in the US. I graduated with a bachelors in Electrical Engineering (Spring 2020) where a pandemic robbed my convocation. Wondering where I'll be next.

Since I was a kid, I've always been fascinated by the tech world. 
A life-long learner to push my limits and excited to see what the world can achieve together. 
Passionate moving forward into an AV and AI world.

Outside of work, I love outdoor activities such as kayaking and hiking.
Active player in many sports, played competitively especially in squash and racquetball.

Fluent in English, Malay, Mandarin, and Cantonese.
